# RGDGT
R code to evaluate isoprenoidal and branched Glycerol Dialkyl Glycerol Tetraethers and H-shaped, branched Glycerol Monoalkyl Glycerol Tetraethers for paleotemperature and paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

Here's how to use it:
download the zip folder and place it on your desktop.

3 r markdown scripts were constructed: If you only have isoprenoid GDGT data, with or without the branched GDGTs to calculate TEX86 and BIT, and SSTs, use "RGDGT TEX BIT.Rmd". If you only have the brGDGTs to reconstruct MAAT, use "RGDGT_isobrGDGT.rmd". If you also have brGMGT data integrated, use "RGDGT_isobrGDGT_brGMGT.rmd".

These three markdowns are to be used, adapted, modified to your needs.
